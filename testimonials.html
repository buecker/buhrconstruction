The roof was very high and the tear off was a dirty job. They conscientiously looked for and repaired and/or replaced the deteriorated and rotted sections of the old roof before proceeding with the new roof.”</p>

<p>“The team shared a strong work ethic and took pride in their work. The quality of their craftsmanship was outstanding, and even the cleanup was well done.
